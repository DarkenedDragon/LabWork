This software is intended to be used to measure the progress of a moving or exapanding colored object.

Instructions for use:
1. Use the ColorFinder program to find the color range that your object is in. 
2. Once you have that range, run the TestTube program and input the upper and lower bounds of the range you just obtained from ColorFinder
3. Select the Region of Interest by dragging a rectangle around the area you wish to process. 
4. Let the program run. It may take several minutes depending on the amount of pictures you are processing. The results can be found in the data.txt file.
