# LabWork
This software is intended to be used to measure the progress of a moving or exapanding colored object.

Instructions for use:
1. Use the ColorFinder program to find the color range that your object is in. 
2. Once you have that range, run the TestTube program and input the upper and lower bounds of the range you just obtained from ColorFinder
3. Select the Region of Interest(ROI) by dragging a rectangle around the area you wish to process. 
4. Let the program run. It may take several minutes depending on the amount of pictures you are processing. The results can be found in the data.txt and the data.csv files.

NOTE: If the returned value is 999, it is the programs's error message and means that it found nothing with in that ROI and color range. 

Included is a Package folder. This contains applications for both ColorFinder and TestTube, that can be run on a 64 bit windows computer.
See the README file in Package for more detailed information on running these programs.
